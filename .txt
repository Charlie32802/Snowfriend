Problems needed to be solve:

1. Snowfriend must respond basd on the context of the user's message, like if the user's message is typing "Hello", make it
understand that context and then find the most perfect and appropriate response.

2. Snowfriend must not be repetitive, just in case if something happens, all automatic messages should have 20 unique and
paraphrased responses each, to ensure that the user doesn't see a robotic companion repetitively iterating the same message over
and over again.

3. Add an "Export" button for Snowfriend to export all conversations between the User and Snowfriend.
